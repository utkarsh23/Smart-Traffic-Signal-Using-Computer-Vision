# Smart Traffic Signal Using Computer Vision

![demo](./demo.JPG)

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how traffic signals can be equipped with computer vision so that these traffic signals communicate with each other via a centralized server and this server decides on the most optimal signal changes, compliant with a set of ground rules. These ground rules may be trivial but of extreme necessity like, you want to ensure no matter what the traffic conditions may be, once a signal is green it should remain so for a predefined period of time (10 seconds in our project demonstration).

## Hardware Components
1. WeMos D1 mini (microcontroller)
2. LEDs (red, yellow, green) for traffic lights
3. Connecting Wires
4. Breadboard
5. Resistors

## Software Requirements
1. Tensorflow Frozen Models
2. Arduino IDE
